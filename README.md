# 📌 Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of generative AI, users increasingly rely on AI-generated content for academics, research, and professional tasks. However, AI systems often produce **hallucinated facts, misleading claims, and fake or broken citations**, making it difficult for users to judge the credibility of the information.
There is a need for a unified platform that helps users **verify AI-generated text before trusting or using it**.
