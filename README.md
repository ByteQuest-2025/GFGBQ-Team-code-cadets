# 📌 Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of generative AI, users increasingly rely on AI-generated content for academics, research, and professional tasks. However, AI systems often produce hallucinated facts, misleading claims, and fake or broken citations, making it difficult for users to judge the credibility of the information.

There is a need for a unified platform that helps users verify AI-generated content before trusting or using it.
